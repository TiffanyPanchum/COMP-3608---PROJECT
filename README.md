## Project Overview

This project aims to develop predictive models for three critical health conditions:
- Diabetes prediction based on health metrics like BMI, glucose levels, and hypertension
- Heart disease risk assessment using clinical data including cholesterol and blood pressure
- Stroke prediction analyzing factors like smoking habits and blood pressure

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing pipeline for medical datasets
- Multiple machine learning models for each disease
- Comparative analysis of risk factors
- Web interface for risk assessment

## Datasets

The project uses three publicly available datasets:

1. **Diabetes Prediction Dataset**
   - Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)
   - Features: BMI, age, smoking status, hypertension, glucose levels
   - Target: Diabetes diagnosis (0/1)

2. **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**
   - Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)
   - Features: Cholesterol, ECG results, blood pressure, etc.
   - Target: Presence of heart disease (0/1)

3. **Stroke Prediction Dataset**
   - Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
   - Features: Blood pressure, glucose levels, smoking habits, etc.
   - Target: Stroke occurrence (0/1)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:
